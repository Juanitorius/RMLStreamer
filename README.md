## RML Framework

#### Installing Flink
The RML Framework runs it's jobs on Flink clusters. More information on how to install Flink and getting clusters up and running can be found [here](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/quickstart/setup_quickstart.html).
At least a local cluster must be running in order to start executing RML Mappings with the RML Framework.
